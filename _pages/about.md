I am a Master of City Planning student at the University of Pennsylvania, concentrating in Smart Cities and Sustainable Transportation Planning. With a background in Architecture and Urban Design, I specialize in transportation planning, system modeling, and analytics. My expertise lies in using spatial design and data-driven visualization to solve complex urban challenges. I approach transportation issues holistically, focusing on how design and innovative technologies can create smarter, more sustainable cities.
